Hi!

This project was done for my Large Scale Software Development class in 2015/2014.  

I worked alongside two other students to develop a non-deterministic finite state machine.

This was implemented with the Model-View-Controller design pattern in mind as shown in the PDF.

WARNING: due to a hard drive issue this particular version of the project may be incomplete.
